# Plugin Repository Clone and Setup Instructions

To clone the plugin repository, follow these steps:

1. Open your preferred terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the following location: `C:/Users/USER/AppData/Roaming/StarUML/extensions/user`.
3. Execute the command: `git clone <repository-url>`. Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the plugin repository.
4. Wait for the cloning process to complete.

After cloning the repository, ensure that the `PickClassStarUml` folder has been successfully created in the mentioned location. Also, make sure to install its dependencies.

To use the XLSX file generation and lodash modules of the plugin, you need to install Node. The recommended version is v18.14.0.

Additionally, you need to install Yarn, as it is the tool responsible for managing the versioning of the plugin's dependencies. The recommended version is v1.22.19.

Once Node and Yarn are installed, follow the steps below:

1. Open the terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root folder of your project.
3. Execute the command: `yarn install`. This will download and install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file of your project.
4. Wait for the installation to finish.

Congratulations! You have successfully cloned the plugin repository, created the necessary folder, and installed the dependencies for your project.
